**Overview of T-SQL:**

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is the proprietary extension of the SQL (Structured Query Language) used by Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases. It is a powerful, procedural, and data manipulation language that allows users to interact with SQL Server databases. T-SQL provides a wide range of features for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data, as well as for managing database objects and security.

Key Features of T-SQL:

1.  Querying Data: T-SQL allows users to retrieve data from one or more tables using the SELECT statement. It supports various clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for filtering, aggregating, and sorting data.
    
2.  Data Manipulation: T-SQL provides statements like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to add, modify, and remove data from tables, respectively.
    
3.  Joins: T-SQL supports different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
    
4.  Subqueries: T-SQL allows users to embed one query within another, known as subqueries, which can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
    
5.  Functions: T-SQL offers a variety of built-in functions, including mathematical functions, string functions, date and time functions, conversion functions, and aggregate functions.
    
6.  Stored Procedures: T-SQL allows users to create and execute stored procedures, which are precompiled sets of SQL statements stored in the database. Stored procedures help encapsulate complex logic and enhance performance.
    
7.  Triggers: T-SQL triggers are special stored procedures that are automatically executed when specific events occur, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table.
    
8.  Transactions: T-SQL provides support for transactions, allowing users to group multiple statements into a single atomic unit of work. Transactions ensure data integrity and consistency by either committing all changes or rolling them back in case of errors.
