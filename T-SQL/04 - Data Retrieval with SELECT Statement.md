**Data Retrieval with SELECT Statement**

The SELECT statement is one of the most fundamental and powerful statements in SQL, including T-SQL used in SQL Server. It is primarily used for retrieving data from one or more tables in a database. The SELECT statement allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, apply filtering conditions, and sort the results. Here is the basic syntax of the SELECT statement:


    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    ORDER BY column_name; 

Let's break down the components of the SELECT statement:

1.  SELECT: This keyword indicates that you want to retrieve data from the database.
    
2.  column1, column2, ...: These are the names of the columns you want to retrieve data from. You can also use wildcard (*) to select all columns.
    
3.  FROM: This keyword specifies the table from which you want to retrieve data.
    
4.  table_name: This is the name of the table from which data will be retrieved.
    
5.  WHERE: This optional clause allows you to specify filtering conditions. Only rows that meet the specified conditions will be included in the result set.
    
6.  condition: The condition is an expression that evaluates to true or false. It is used to filter the rows based on specific criteria.
    
7.  ORDER BY: This optional clause is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
    
8.  column_name: This is the name of the column by which you want to sort the data. You can specify multiple columns for sorting, separated by commas.
    

Example:

Let's say we have a table called "Employees" with columns "EmployeeID," "FirstName," "LastName," "Department," and "Salary." To retrieve the names of all employees whose salary is greater than $50,000 and sort the results by salary in descending order, the SQL query would look like:

sqlCopy code

    SELECT FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 50000
    ORDER BY Salary DESC;

 

This query will return the first name and last name of employees whose salary is greater than $50,000, sorted in descending order of their salary.

The SELECT statement is a powerful tool for retrieving specific data from a database, and it can be combined with other clauses and functions to perform complex data retrieval operations in SQL Server.
